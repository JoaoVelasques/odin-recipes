    <h2> Gyudon is one of the most popular rice bowl dishes in Japan. Shall we cook Gyudon tonight?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions(very thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>1 pound very thinly sliced beef (fatty beef chuck or ribeye)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup dashi stock (can also substitute beef or chicken stock)</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked japanese white rice</li>
        <li>1 scallion</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the neutral oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!</li>
        <li>When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among serving bowls (the original recipe is for 4, so 4 bowls), and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.</li>
    </ol>
